// Problem Analysis
// We need to count how many connected components of land ('1') exist in a 2D grid.
// Connected means adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
// Each time we find a land cell '1', we can run DFS/BFS to mark the entire island as visited.
// Finally, count how many times we initiate a search.
// This is the classic "Number of Islands" problem â†’ solved with DFS / BFS / Union-Find.

// Complexity Analysis
// Time Complexity:
// Each cell is visited at most once.
// O(m * n).
// Space Complexity:
// Recursion depth = O(m * n) in worst case (all land).
// Iterative BFS version would use a queue of size up to O(m * n).
